## User Flow

When a new user first interacts with the SEO Research Assistant, they will begin by either registering an account via email or using the OAuth integration with existing Google or Facebook accounts. Once authenticated, they will land on the primary dashboard, which serves as the control center for the application. Here, users can create a new project or access an existing one with shared access permissions. The intuitive navigation provides easy access to various modules like keyword research, competitor analysis, and content planning.

To perform keyword research, the user inputs desired keywords, which the platform analyzes for difficulty, volume, and trends. Concurrently, they can carry out competitor analysis using tools designed for backlink checking and SERP monitoring. Once the data is collected and analyzed, users can plan their content using the content calendar and meta tag tools. The application allows users to generate detailed reports that can be downloaded or scheduled for automatic delivery based on selected metrics.
