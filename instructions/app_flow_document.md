# App Flow Document for SEO Research Assistant

## Introduction

The SEO Research Assistant is a web-based application that streamlines the SEO research and optimization process. It is designed to serve digital marketing professionals, SEO specialists, content creators, business owners, marketing agencies, and website developers by providing essential tools for keyword research, competitor analysis, and content planning. The primary goal of the user journey is to facilitate an efficient, intuitive experience by integrating various analytics and data visualization features into a single comprehensive platform.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

A new user typically discovers the SEO Research Assistant either through a marketing campaign, referrals, or direct invite links which lead them to the app's landing page. On this page, users can explore the tool’s features and sign up using their email or social media accounts via OAuth integration with Google or Facebook. The sign-up process involves providing basic details and accepting the terms of service. Upon successful registration, the user receives a verification email to confirm their account. Existing users can log in directly using their registered email or OAuth credentials. In case of forgotten passwords, there's an option to recover access through a password reset email, which guides the user to set a new password. Once authenticated, users can also easily sign out from the account menu for security purposes.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon logging in, users are greeted with the main dashboard, which serves as the central hub of the application. This dashboard showcases an overview of all active projects with key metrics displayed in interactive widgets. The navigation bar on the left offers quick links to major sections—Keyword Research, Competitor Analysis, Content Planning, and Reports. At the top, a project selector allows users to switch between different projects they have access to. The overall layout is designed for ease of access, enabling users to jump from one task to another seamlessly.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

### Project Management

Users can create a new project by selecting the 'New Project' button on the dashboard. This leads to a form where project details such as name, description, and team members are inputted. Existing projects can be managed through a dedicated section accessible from the dashboard, where users can edit details, archive, or delete projects. Shared access permissions can be set here, granting or restricting users' access to specific projects.

### Keyword Research

In the keyword research module, users can enter desired keywords into a search bar, triggering a comprehensive analysis displaying keyword difficulty, search volume, and trending topics. The results are visualized using charts and graphs, all accessible from a single page. Users can filter these results for deeper insights or export them for further analysis.

### Competitor Analysis

Navigating to the competitor analysis section leads users to a set of tools designed for comprehensive competitor review. Here, users input competitor URLs to receive backlink data, view content gaps, and track SERP performance. Each analysis page is designed to present data succinctly, with options to delve deeper into specific metrics like domain authority or backlink profiles.

### Content Planning

Users looking to plan their content efficiently can access the content planner, which includes a calendar view and meta tag generation tools. They can schedule content, set deadlines, and organize topics within this module. By using the meta tag generator, users can optimize content presentations directly from within the app.

### Reporting System

The reporting system allows users to generate detailed reports based on selected metrics, which can be customized and exported as PDFs. Users can also schedule these reports for periodic delivery via email. This functionality is especially beneficial for team reviews and client meetings.

## Settings and Account Management

From any page, users can access the settings menu found within the main app navigation bar. Here, they can update personal details, change passwords, and configure notification preferences. In the account settings section, users can manage billing and subscription details if they are on a paid plan, including updating payment information or upgrading to a higher tier. After making necessary changes, users can easily return to the main app flow by closing the settings menu or navigating via the dashboard.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If users input invalid data, such as an incorrect password during login, appropriate error messages are displayed, guiding them to correct the information. For actions like entering non-existent keywords or competitor URLs, feedback is provided through notification banners, suggesting potential next steps. In cases of network issues, a user-friendly offline page is displayed with options to retry once connectivity is restored. These error states are designed to be informative and help users recover the normal workflow with minimal disruption.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The SEO Research Assistant offers a streamlined experience from sign-up through everyday usage, helping users achieve their objectives like publishing optimized content and staying ahead of competitors through data-driven insights. Each part of the application interconnects to enhance user efficiency and decision-making.
