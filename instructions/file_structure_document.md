# File Structure Document

## Introduction

A well-organized file structure is crucial in any software development project as it fosters efficient collaboration among developers, simplifies the management of code, and enhances overall project maintainability. For the SEO Research Assistant application, a clear file structure is particularly important due to its comprehensive scope, integrating various features for SEO research, content planning, and extensive database management. This document serves to provide an unambiguous overview of the file structure for all stakeholders, ensuring that the project’s organization is understandable and navigable.

## Overview of the Tech Stack

The SEO Research Assistant leverages a diverse tech stack aimed at delivering a robust, scalable, and user-friendly application. The frontend is built using React.js for dynamic and responsive interfaces, complemented by Redux for state management and Material-UI for stylish, consistent components. D3.js or Chart.js is utilized for advanced data visualization. The backend employs Node.js with Express to build RESTful APIs, integrated with GraphQL for efficient data querying and WebSocket for real-time updates. The database layer comprises PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB to manage and optimize various types of data. This diverse tech stack influences the file structure, encouraging a modular setup for seamless integration and maintenance across different components.

## Root Directory Structure

At the root level, the project directory is organized into several key folders and files designed to streamline development processes. Here is an overview:

*   **/src**: The primary directory containing all source code for the frontend and backend components.
*   **/config**: Houses configuration files necessary for setting up different environments and integrating third-party services.
*   **/scripts**: Contains custom scripts for automating tasks such as data migration or build processes.
*   **README.md**: A detailed document providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and developer guidelines.
*   **package.json**: Essential file for managing project dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
*   **Dockerfile**: Describes the container environment for the application, ensuring consistent deployment.

## Frontend File Structure

The frontend is organized to promote modularity and reusability, crucial for maintaining a dynamic user interface. Here’s the structure:

*   **/src/components**: Includes React components, each in its dedicated folder, containing related JavaScript, CSS, and test files.
*   **/src/redux**: Manages global state via actions, reducers, and store configuration.
*   **/src/assets**: Stores static files such as images, fonts, and branding elements.
*   **/src/styles**: Contains global styles and CSS modules to ensure consistency across components.
*   **/src/utils**: Includes utility functions and helper modules that support the frontend logic.

## Backend File Structure

The backend is structured to enhance maintainability and scalability through the separation of concerns. The key directories include:

*   **/src/api**: Organizes RESTful API routes and related logic.
*   **/src/controllers**: Manages how requests are processed, controlling the flow between models and views.
*   **/src/models**: Represents database models and includes schema definitions for PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
*   **/src/services**: Contains business logic and service implementations connecting controllers and data layers.
*   **/src/middleware**: Houses middleware functions for request validation, authentication, and logging.

## Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration files are vital for customizing the application’s behavior across different environments. Within the project:

*   **.env**: Holds environment variables passed to the application, such as API keys and database URLs.
*   **config.json**: Contains configuration settings for different environments (development, staging, production).
*   **.eslint.json**: Specifies linting rules to ensure code quality and consistency.

## Testing and Documentation Structure

Testing and documentation are integral to maintaining quality and knowledge sharing:

*   **/tests**: A comprehensive directory for unit and integration tests, organized to mirror the source structure for ease of navigation.
*   **/docs**: Contains detailed documentation, including API specifications, user guides, and developer notes to support ongoing development and onboarding.

## Conclusion and Overall Summary

The SEO Research Assistant’s file structure is meticulously organized to support its multi-faceted functionality and scalability. Such a structure not only accelerates development but also ensures long-term maintainability and adaptability to future enhancements. Unique aspects of this organization include the clear distinction between frontend and backend components and the comprehensive approach to testing and documentation, setting this project apart from simpler, less integrated applications.
